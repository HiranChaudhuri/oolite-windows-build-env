Add a .diff against original Microsoft DirectX 7.0 SDK header files here.
The patch should not include files not existant in this archive, in other words
do not use the -N parameter with diff.

In case the header files are not modified, rename this file to readme.txt and
put in it an explanation that whoever modifies the original header files
should leave a complete diff patch in this directory.
