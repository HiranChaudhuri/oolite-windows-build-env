Use this package and drop me a line if you find it useful. That makes it easier to me to improve this package and add additional stuff.

ABOUT VERSIONING THIS PACKAGE
This package and all further packages have now a version.
To make it short: Every DirectX.DevPak will now be named DirectX SDK and the
package version will include the version of the DXSDK followed by the extension 
of an evenutal update. So it is easier to determine what release is installed and 
what updates are available.

NOTES:
A new directory called common will be installed to your Dev-C++ installation directory. This directory contains helper functions of the original DirectX9 SDK slightly modified to work with Dev-Cpp
There are also some example applications converted from the DirectX application wizard and placed as templates in the template folder of your Dev-Cpp installation. A directx icon is copied to the icons
folder. 

USING:
When working with the DirectX stuff installed on your machine make sure to select a Windows Application if you don't like the DirectX application template. After linking the libraries in the DirectX9 folder make sure to set the project paths for include files and libraries to the DirectX9 subfolder. That makes your life easier if you are new to programming.

FILES:
- included header files
- included lib files for MinGW compiler
- included lib files from the DXSDK (original)
- included Templates made with the DirectX application wizard
- DirectX.ico added
