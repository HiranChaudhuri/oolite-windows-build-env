This sample was created with the DirectX application wizard.

TODO:
1) configure the paths in the linker tab of your project settings.
   You have to correct the paths of the files dinput.lib and dsound.lib.
   These libraries are copied into your lib directory of your Dev-Cpp installation and 
   you have to include them correctly to compile and link the project.

2) You might also want to correct the name of the application icon. You can find this
   in the file DXApp.rc

3) Please remove the file bounce.wav from your project tree.Maybe this file is damaged,
   so no sound will play when pressing F5.
   Just get the file from your Common/media/ folder and copy it to your application folder.

4) And last but not least: Don't forget to exclude this file from building. :-)

Enjoy
